 A simple tip while you kickstart your programming journey:
 <br>
 <ul>
    <li>It is very likely that you would feel uninterested and feel like giving
        up once you get stuck somewhere in between. 
    </li>
    <li>
        In that case just try to remind yourself why you started. That way you would be
        able to get back your earlier motivation. 
    </li>
    <li>
        If it feels a mundane task, then take your time and ease out for a while. Refresh
        your mind and get back to your work stronger.
    </li>
    <li>
    Something is way better than nothing. Try to code for atleast 20 min daily. It will
    keep your hands firm in programming.    
    </li>
 </ul>
