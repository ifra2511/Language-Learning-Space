<h3>Why the word HyperText & Markup Language mean?</h3>
<p>
The word hypertext markup language comprises the words “hypertext” and “markup language”. The term "hypertext" refers to the linking of text with other documents and “markup language” refers to a language that uses a set of tags.
So, HTML is the linking of text with other documents using some set of tags.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Note:- Tags refers to some meaningful texts enclosed in angle braces <...>. For eg <head>.
<br>
Each tag has a different meaning and importance in building an HTML page which can affect the web page in its own ways

<h3>A beautiful analogy to understand HTML:</h3>
<img src="../Assets/HTML analogy.png">
<p>
    <b><i>Here in the explanation for the above analogy, the car skeleton refers to HTML with the page body. When that skeleton is painted it the car gets CSS and after all that car is provided with some functionalities like engine, etc (which refers to JavaScript), the car gets life and can run. Similarly, when we develop our websites we need HTML for the structure and if we want our website to look good and prettier we need CSS and if we want to add functionalities to our webpage we need JavaScript.</i> </b>
