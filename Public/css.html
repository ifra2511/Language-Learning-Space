        <br>
        <h2>CSS Overview</h2>
    </center>
   <h3>History</h3> 
    <p>CSS was created by Håkon Wium Lie to allow web designers to change their website's layout, colours, and fonts. Originally, websites were meant to be used by researchers only, so the decoration did not matter. However, the need to make them look nice grew when websites became widespread.
    </p>
    <h3>Why the word “Cascade”?</h3>
    <p>The Cascade determines which CSS rules will be applied when multiple rules for an item are contradicting in the style sheet. </p>
    <ul>
    <h3>Key features of CSS</h3>
    <li>Used to style and layout webpages</li>
    <li> Written in HTML and XML</li>
    <li>The last version was CSS 2.1, but seeing the scope everything now comes under the  umbrella of CSS without any version number.</li>
    <li>Reusability of the same rules for multiple HTML documents.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>Why learn CSS?</h3>
    <p>CSS though optional, adds beauty to a website. It helps the user to design a majestic website according to their own liking.</p>
    <h3>So without wasting any time let’s start with your first CSS website.</h3>
